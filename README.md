frser-duino
===========
Port that supports the teensy 3.1 board. 

Build using the arduino project in arduino with the teensyduino installed. 

This board is nice since it has emulated serial - it is much faster at processing serial data than traditional arduino targets.
Alternative code to serprog-duino.
